# Neural Networks: Ground Up
A collection of notebooks and scripts exploring Deep Learning without high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow (initially). 

**Key Goals:**
- Master backpropagation by implementing it in raw NumPy.
- Follow and replicate concepts from Andrej Karpathy's lectures.
* **YouTube Playlist:** [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
* **Official GitHub Repo:** [karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero)

- Build a solid intuition for how weights, biases, and gradients interact.
