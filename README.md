# Neural Networks: Ground Up
A collection of notebooks and scripts exploring Deep Learning without high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow (initially). 

**Key Goals:**
- Master backpropagation by implementing it in raw NumPy.
- Follow and replicate concepts from Andrej Karpathy's lectures.
- Build a solid intuition for how weights, biases, and gradients interact.
